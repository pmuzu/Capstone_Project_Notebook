Introduction"}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "Lots of factors go into making a great cultural city and living in a city that values art and entertainment is not only important for the locals, but it is also the main attraction for the tourists. Excellent art galleries and museums are a good starting point. Then there need to be venues for theater and music of all types, from symphony halls to jazz clubs. Whether cheering for your favorite team or dancing listening to your favorite artists, there\u2019s an activity for everyone.\n\nLet\u2019s assume now that you want to move or travel from abroad to the U.S. and you want to find yourself in a city with a high density of arts and entertainment places around you. The purpose of this project is to explore the Arts and Entertainment locations in five major U.S. cities and find the city which best meets your varied cultural, entertainment, and recreational interests."}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": "### 2.

This category comprises (1) establishments that are involved in producing, promoting, or participating in live performances, events, or exhibits intended for public viewing; (2) establishments that preserve and exhibit objects and sites of historical, cultural, or educational interest; and (3) establishments that operate facilities or provide services that enable patrons to participate in recreational activities or pursue amusement, hobby, and leisure-time interests. \n\nI would use the FourSquare API in order to collect the data for all Art and Entertainment locations in five major US cities which are: New York, NY, San Francisco, CA, Jersey City, NJ, Boston, MA and Chicago, IL. These are one of the most populated U.S. cities and I am hopeful that they will contain the best Art and Entertainment places in the U.S.\n\nThe main purpose of this project is to find the city with the highest Art and Entertainment locations density.\n\nI would have to use the FourSquare API through the venues channel and I would have to use the near query to get the venues in the cities. Moreover, I would have to use the Category ID to set it to show only Art & Entertainment places. \n\nAn Example of this requests is: https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore?&client_id=&client_secret=&v=20200427&NewYork,NY&limit=100&categoryId=4d4b7104d754a06370d81259\n\nThat 4d4b7104d754a06370d81259 is the Id of the Art & Entertainment Category and the Foursquare limitation is up to 100 venues per query.\n\nIn addition, I would have to repeat this request for all the five cities and get their top 100 venues. Then, I would have to save the data only from the results and plotted them on the map for visual inspection.\n\nAfterwards, I would have to create an indicator of the density of the Art & Entertainment locations and calculate a center coordinate of the venues in order to get the mean longitude and latitude values. Finally, I would have to calculate the mean of the Euclidean distance from each venue to the mean coordinates, which it is my indicator, mean distance to the mean coordinate."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.6.9"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
